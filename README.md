MDD-1306
========

import the sql dump from FullMPG/assets/sql_dump as database fmpg.

This is my MDD web application named Full MPG.

I have not been able to get this application to the end result that I was shooting for.

I am using the google maps API to load current location in the world on the home page.
I also have user create, user update, and delete functionality for members after joining.
ers can log in and add their current mileage, amounts of fuel added and tally up fuel efficiency as well as current cost of running their vehicle based on the cost of fuel in their area.
